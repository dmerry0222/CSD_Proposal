   DOCUMENTS — this is the only list you maintain.

     title  : what shows in the side rail
     date   : free text — "2026", "July 2026", "July 15, 2026", whatever
              suits the document. Shows on its own line.
     author : person or office. Wraps to two lines, then truncates with
              an ellipsis, so long office names are safe to type in full.
     file  : SharePoint link, or a local path like "docs/name.pdf".
             Leave as "" and the thumbnail opens a "not linked yet" note.
     thumb : local image path like "thumb/name.png".
             Leave as "" and a generic page graphic is drawn instead.
             Landscape images sit as a banner above the text. Portrait
             images (report covers, 8.5x11 screengrabs) are detected
             automatically and fill the whole card, with the text on a
             white scrim across the bottom. Add  portrait:true  to an
             entry to force that treatment on a squarer image.

   SharePoint tip: use Copy link from the document library, then delete
   everything from the "?" onward. Keep the quotes.
